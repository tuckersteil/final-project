# Phase-5 Project 
My phase 5 project is a app that allows you to search for trainers all over the U.S. and book individual or group training sessions with them. The name of my app is "All Things Active", which implies your able to search for all sorts of active training activities.  You are not limited to main sports such as basketball or football, you can search for karate, chiropractor, and even yoga classes. The main goal of this app is to make a one stop shop for...you guessed it, all things active!

# Functionality 
1. When you first visit the site, you will be prompted to either sign in or sign up.  After making an account you will be directed to the Home page. 
2. The Home page is composed of a welcome message and a search form, where you can search an activity and location. 
3. Once you enter the search and click "find your trainer" you will be taken to a page of all the trainers that offer training for the location and activity you entered.
4. From there you can then click on a trianer to see all the activities they offer. 
5. Once on the trainer page you can schedule a session for the activity you initially searched for, in addition to other activities that trainer offers. 
6. Once you click "schedule", you will be taken to a confirmation page with that trainers calendar. To which you can book a time and date based on that trainers availibility. 
7. Once you confirm and schedule the session, you will be directed to the my bookings tab.  Where you can see all of the bookings youve ever made. 
8. From there, you can also delete your booking, or update the time/date of the booking.
